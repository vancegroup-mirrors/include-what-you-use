// The include-picker provides a list of candidate #include-lines
// that iwyu can suggest in order to include a particular symbol
// or file.
//
// It seems like the 'file' case would be easy ("to include
// /usr/include/math.h, say '#include <math.h>"), but it's
// not because many header files are private, and should not
// be included by users directly.  A private header will have
// one or (occassionally) more public headers that it maps to.
// The include-picker keeps track of these mappings.
//
// It's also possible for a public file to have an include-picker
// mapping.  This means: "it's ok to #include this file directly, but
// you can also get the contents of this file by #including this other
// file as well."  One example is that <ostream> maps to both
// <ostream> and <iostream>.  Other parts of iwyu can decide which
// #include to suggest based on its own heuristics (whether the file
// already needs to #include <iostream> for some other reason, for
// instance).
//
// Some of these mappings are hard-coded, based on my own examination
// of gcc headers on ubuntu.  Some mappings are determined at runtime,
// based on #pragmas or other writeup in the source files themselves.
//
// Mapping a symbol to a file has the same issues.  In most cases, a
// symbol maps to the file that defines it, and iwyu_include_picker
// has nothing useful to say.  But some symbols -- which we hard-code
// -- can be provided by several files.  NULL is a canonical example
// of this.
//
// The include-picker also provides some helper functions for
// converting from file-paths to #include paths, including, routines to
// normalize a file-path to get rid of /usr/include/ prefixes.
